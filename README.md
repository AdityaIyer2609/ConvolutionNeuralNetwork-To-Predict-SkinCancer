# ConvolutionNeuralNetwork-To-Predict-SkinCancer
Convolution Neural Network to predict Skin cancer.Skin cancer is considered as one of the most dangerous types of cancers and there is a drastic increase in the rate of deaths due to lack of knowledge on the symptoms and their prevention. Thus, early detection at premature stage is necessary so that one can prevent the spreading of cancer. Skin cancer is further divided into various types out of which the most hazardous ones are Melanoma, Basal cell carcinoma and Squamous cell carcinoma. This project is about detection and classification of various types of skin cancer using machine learning and image processing tools. This model takes in image as input and tells you whether your skin cancer is Malignant or Benign. I got this dataset online. I trained this model for 25 epochs and achieved an accuracy of 89%. The Convolution Layer extracts the features of the images and is passed through a Deep Neural Network which uses Relu and sigmoid Activation functions to give us the final Output
